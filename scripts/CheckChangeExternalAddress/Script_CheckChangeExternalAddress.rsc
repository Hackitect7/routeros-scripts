# The script is intended for RouterOS.
# Script name: "CheckChangeExternalAddress"
# Author: Hackitect7
# Year: 2025

# License: MIT
#
# For this script, you need to set the following policies: read, write, policy, test
#
# IMPORTANT:
# In the script, locate the line with the email address:
#     :local SendTo "YOUR_NAME@DOMAIN.com";
# Replace "YOUR_NAME@DOMAIN.com" with your actual email address
# where you want to receive the CPU load alerts from RouterOS.
#
# Without this, the script will not be able to send email notifications properly.
#
# Description:
# This script checks the device's external IP address by querying the ipify API (http://api.ipify.org).
# If the external IP address has changed since the last check, it sends an email notification with details.
#
# Example of the email message text sent:
#
# Subject: Mikrotik INFO: MyRouter [2025-07-14 11:32:00] External IP address has changed.
#
# IP Address Change Notification
#
# Device: MyRouter
# Date: 2025-07-14
# Time: 11:32:00
# New IP Address: 203.0.113.47
# Previous IP Address: 203.0.113.14
#
# This is an automated message.
#
# How to apply:
# 1. Open the MikroTik terminal (Winbox -> New Terminal, or SSH/WebFig terminal).
# 2. Create a new script and paste the entire contents of this file:
#
#    /system script add name=CPUOverloadCheck policy=read,write,policy,test source=...
#
# 3. Ensure that another script named "SendEmailFunction" exists â€” this script depends on it
#    to send alert emails.
#
# 4. Set up a scheduler to run this script every X minutes or hours depending on your monitoring needs:
#
#    /system scheduler add \
#        name=CheckChangeExternalAddress \
#        interval=5m \
#        on-event="/system script run CheckChangeExternalAddress;" \
#        comment="Check Change External IP address and notify" \
#        policy=read,write,policy,test \
#        start-time=startup
#
# Additional requirements and tips:
#
# 1. SMTP Configuration:
#    Configure SMTP settings correctly under `/tool e-mail`.
#
# 2. Customization:
#    - You can adjust the number of measurements or threshold values for your environment.
#    - You can attach log export or status files if needed (adjust SendEmail call).
#
# 3. Security:
#    Set user permissions and policies cautiously to protect the script from modification.
